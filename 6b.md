# Color
The color property allows you to specify the color of text inside an element. You can specify any color in CSS in one of three ways:
1. **rgb values:**
These express colors in terms of how much red, green and blue are used to make it up. For example: rgb(100,100,90)
2. **hex codes:**
These are six-digit codes that represent the amount of red, green and blue in a color, preceded by a pound or hash #sign. For example: #ee3e80
3. **color names:**
There are 147 predefined color names that are recognized by browsers. For example: DarkCyan
# understanding color
Every color on a computer screen is created by mixing amounts of red,
green, and blue.
| RGB      | HEX    | NAME    |
| :------------- | :----------: | -----------: |
| Values for red,green, and blue are expressed as numbers between 0 and 255.| Hex values represent values for red, green, and blue in hexadecimal code.|Colors are represented by predefined names. However, they are very limited in number.
rgb(102,205,170) This color is made up of the following values:102 red,205 green,170 blue|#66cdaa The value of the red, 102, is expressed as 66 in hexadecimal code. The 205 of the green is expressed as cd and the 170 of the blue equates to aa.|MediumAquaMarine There are 147 color names supported by browsers (this color is MediumAquaMarine). Most consider this to be a limited color palette, and it is hard to remember the name for each of the colors so (apart from white and black) they are not commonly used.

## CSS3 introduces an entirely new and intuitive way to specify colors using hue, saturation, and lightness values.

* **hue:**
Hue is the colloquial idea of color. In HSL colors, hue is often represented as a color circle where the angle represents the color, although it may also be shown as a slider with values from 0 to 360.
* **saturation:**
Saturation is the amount of
gray in a color. Saturation is
represented as a percentage.
100% is full saturation and 0%
is a shade of gray.
* **lightness:**
Lightness is the amount of
white (lightness) or black
(darkness) in a color. Lightness
is represented as a percentage.
0% lightness is black, 100%
lightness is white, and 50%
lightness is normal. Lightness
is sometimes referred to as
luminosity.
