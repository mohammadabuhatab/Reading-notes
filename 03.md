Now that you know what needs to appear on your site, you can start to organize the information into sections or pages.
# Site Maps
The aim is to create a diagram of the pages that will be used to structure the site. This is known as a site map and it will show how those pages can be grouped.
To help you decide what information should go on each page, you can use a technique called card sorting.

# WireFrames
A wireframe is a simple sketch of the key
information that needs to go on each page of a
site. It shows the hierarchy of the information
and how much space it might require.

# HTML5 specifications 
1. The new HTML5 elements i XX ndicate the purpose of different parts of a web page and help to describe its structure.
2. The new elements provide clearer code (compared
with using multiple <div> elements).
3.  Older browsers that do not understand HTML5
elements need to be told which elements are
block-level elements.
4. To make HTML5 elements work in Internet Explorer 8
(and older versions of IE), extra JavaScript is needed,
which is available free from Google.
